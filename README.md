# Linux from Scratch 7.8

This Shell scripts have for purpose to let you to speed up the process to build a LFS system.

The steps are based on the instruction of Linux From Scratch implementation 7.8.

## What does it do?
Running all the steps until the reboot of 9.3 will give a running LFS on your host machine (you can choose it from the GRUB at boot) :)

## Instructions
The raport can be found in french at the root of this repo: Instructions_FR.pdf.
There will be an english version Markdown soon... soon... (I don't know when to be honest, but one day!)

However, note that all the instructions in the scripts themselves are in english. So... If it's alright with you... I don't think you need my report to be translated right away..
